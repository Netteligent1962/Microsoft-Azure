# Microsoft Azure
I'm at Microsoft to satisfy my curiosity at the pivotal moment. Presciently, there are so much to learn, build and deliver an effective hybrid strategy to respond to today’s changing business needs and to prepare for the future. You’ll get insights from industry experts, best practices based on real-world examples, and details on how to extend Azure services and management to any infrastructure with Azure Arc.. Fortunately, Microsoft has so much to share and transfer pratical knowledges to the world and I am grateful.
Microsoft Azure, Teams, Networking, Security, GitHub, Serverless, Microservices, Container, Kubernetes and more than 100 services completely transform the way Development and IT teams design, build and manage enterprise and hybrid infrastructures.
