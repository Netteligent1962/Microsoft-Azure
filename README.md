# Microsoft Azure
I'm at Microsoft to satisfy my curiosity at the pivotal moment. Presciently, there are so much to learn and utilize new skills. Fortunately, Microsoft has so much to share and transfer knowledges to the world and I am grateful.
Microsoft Azure, GitHub, Serverless, Microservices, Container, Kubernetes and more than 100 services completely transform the way Development and IT teams design, build and manage enterprise and hybrid infrastructures.
